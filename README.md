# How to create a erc1155 contract and connect a Celo wallet in your app
In this tutorial we'll write a smart contract using the Solidity language and a contract from the Openzeppelin library for ERC1155 tokens. Using nodejs along with Hardhat we will compile the smart contract code and also test the contract before deploying it. After deploying the contract we will create a custom task within Hardhat to create a Celo account and deploy the contract to the Celo network using [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io). Lastly, we are going to use `create-react-app` to generate a React application that will connect to the Celo wallet account and interact with the deployed smart contract.

# Prerequisites 
 - We must have NodeJS >= v12.0 installed, preferably the latest version or an LTS release.
 - Knowledge of JavaScript, Solidity and React is beneficial.

# Install and use Hardhat
Hardhat is a development environment that compiles, deploys, tests, and helps you to debug your Ethereum smart contracts. Hardhat can also be used to deploy to the Celo network because Celo also runs the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This means smart contracts which work on Ethereum will also work on Celo. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will assume that the reader understands how to initialize a new Node project with a package manager (`npm` or `yarn`). We will go over how to install and configure Hardhat now.

#### Installing Hardhat
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers web3 @celo/contractkit
```

#### Creating a new Hardhat project
From within the project directory, run :
```bash
npx hardhat
```
Selecting 'Create a sample project' will allow Hardhat to start its installation process in the current directory. It will create subdirectories and put all of the necessary files in place to empower your project. 
```bash
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888

## Now we'll write our smart contract

### Smart contracts using the OpenZeppelin ERC1155 library
ERC1155 is a novel token standard that aims to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract.
ERC1155 draws ideas from all of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777. ERC1155s are commonly used in NFT collectible projects, although they are not typically viewed as 'fine art' it is not unreasonable to use this token standard for such purposes. We will examine the use case of a token meant specifically for use within our Tiny Village.

### Install the OpenZeppelin contracts and create your smart contract file
 ```bash
npm install --save-dev @openzeppelin/contracts
touch  contracts/TinyVillage.sol
```
#### Write your smart contract 
Let's add a license to your code ```SPDX License Identifier```, the source code of the smart contract will be visible on the blockchain, it's a best practice to add a license to your code to avoid the problem if other people use this code.  with ```pragma solidity ^0.8.0;``` we'll choose a compilation version,the compile version of your code and libraries must be compatible,The ```import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol``` will import the ERC1155.sol and other solidity files that ERC1155 will need to compile. Create the ``` contract TinyVillage  is ERC1155``` and tell to use library ERC1155.

### âš  If you are using Remix import the ERC1155 module using.
```solidity
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
```
 ```solidity
 //SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
 contract TinyVillage  is ERC1155 {
}
```
### Write the NFT parth of smart contract
Inside the ```contract TinyVillage  is ERC1155``` create the Nfts's Ids  ```uint256 public constant VILLAGE```the name is useful to remember the Ids it is possible to pass just the number without saving in a variable.
```solidity
 uint256 public constant VILLAGE = 0;
 _mint(msg.sender,VILLAGE,1,"0x000");
 //The code are the same 
 _mint(msg.sender,0,1,"0x000");
```
create the list with ours NFTs and the ```constructor()```, The constructor code is executed once when a contract is created and it's used to initialize contract state.
 ```solidity
 uint256 public constant VILLAGE = 0;
 uint256 public constant MINE = 1;
 uint256 public constant FARM = 2;
 uint256 public constant MILL = 3;
 uint256 public constant CASTLE = 4;
 
 constructor() ERC1155("https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTN32qBKYqnyvatqfnU8ra6cYUGNxpYziSddCatEmopLR/metadata/api/item/{id}.json") {
  }
```
When an App ou wallet for use this contract it will change the {id} in the for an NFT Id that the user has. For example, the Mine id is 1 to get NFT metadata will use this URL ```https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTN32qBKYqnyvatqfnU8ra6cYUGNxpYziSddCatEmopLR/metadata/api/item/1.json```
```json
{
  "name": "Mine",
  "description": "Mine inseda a tiny mount",
  "image": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPoFKTD8U2Mg6kgMheyv9K4rtPRnKv78orRHjaYaTVqNm/images/mine.png"
}
```
### Write the function will mint the NFTs
Our function has 2 parts,```require(balanceOf(msg.sender,id) == 0,"<Error mensagem>")``` ,Get the balance and it is only possible to mint an NFT if you do not have the same Nft
and the ```_mint(<Address of when called the contract>,<NFT's id>,<quantity>,<extra date>);```.
 ```solidity
 //If you do not have any village the contract will let you buy one
 function mintVillage() public{
     require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) == 0,"you already have a Village ");
     _mint(msg.sender,VILLAGE,1,"0x000");
 }

 //If you do not have any Mine and have Village the contract will let you buy the Mine
 function mintMine() public{
     require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) > 0,"you need have a Village");
     require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MINE) == 0,"you already have a Mine");
     _mint(msg.sender,MINE,1,"0x000");
 }

 //If you do not have any Farm and have Village the contract will let you buy the Farm
 function mintFarm() public{
     require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) > 0,"you need have a Village");
     require(balanceOf(msg.sender,FARM) == 0,"you already have a Farm");
     _mint(msg.sender,FARM,1,"0x000");
 }
    
   //If you do not have any Mill and have Village and Farm the contract will let you buy the Mill
   function mintMill() public{
       require(balanceOf(msg.sender,VILLAGE) > 0,"you need have a Village");
       require(balanceOf(msg.sender,FARM) > 0,"you need have a Farm");
       require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MILL) == 0,"you already have a Mill");
       _mint(msg.sender,MILL,1,"0x000");
   }

   //If you do not have any Castle and have all others NFt the contract will let you buy the Mill
   function mintCastle() public{
       require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MINE) > 0,"you need have a Mine");
       require(balanceOf(msg.sender,MILL) > 0,"you need have a Mill");
       require(balanceOf(msg.sender,CASTLE) == 0,"you already have a Castle");
       _mint(msg.sender,CASTLE,1,"0x000");
   }
```
#### [TinyVillage.sol complete code ](https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/blob/main/demo/contracts/TinyVillage.sol)

### Use Harthat to compile
First,delete ```contracts/Greeter.sol``` and the ```test/sample-test.js```,Go to ```hardhat.config.js``` and add the same version ou are using in the **TinyVillage.sol** smart contract.
 ```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
};
```
run the ```npx hardhat compile```, if you have not deleted the ```contracts/Greeter.sol``` it's will give an error because  that the contract doesn't have the same version.
 ```bash
npx hardhat compile

Solidity 0.8.0 is not fully supported yet. You can still use Hardhat, but some features, like stack traces, might not work correctly.
Learn more at https://hardhat.org/reference/solidity-support"
Compiling 9 files with 0.8.0
Compilation finished successfully
```
### Use Harthat to test you smart contract
the best practive is test the smart contract in your machine before deploy, create a file ```test/tineyVillageTest.js```. The [hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/truffle-testing.html) has more information about testing using other libraries. 

Import the module chai, it's are our test library,it was installed in the first part of this tutorial 
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
```
It's the simple test, just deploying the contract and minting the village,if the contract minted a Village the contract will pass
```javascript
describe("TinyVillage Test", function() {
    it("Should mint village", async function() {
        ```
        const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();

        const TinyVillage = await ethers.getContractFactory("TinyVillage");
        const tinyVillage = await TinyVillage.deploy();

        await tinyVillage.mintVillage();
        const balance = await tinyVillage.balanceOf(accounts[0].address,0)
        expect(1).to.equal(Number(balance.toString()));
    });
```
The more complex test, to mint a castle we'll need to mint every other NFT,For this tutorial don't take a long time, we won't test all the minting functions 
```javascript
    it("Should mint castle",async function () {
        const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();

        const TinyVillage = await ethers.getContractFactory("TinyVillage");
        const tinyVillage = await TinyVillage.deploy();

        await tinyVillage.mintVillage();
        await tinyVillage.mintMine();
        await tinyVillage.mintFarm();
        await tinyVillage.mintMill();
        await tinyVillage.mintCastle();
        const balance = await tinyVillage.balanceOf(accounts[0].address, 4)
        expect(1).to.equal(Number(balance.toString()));
    });
});
```
Now run hardhat again to test ```npx hardhat test```,depending of your machine the test time may be different , if all tests have passed your smart contract are ready to deploy 
```bash
 npx hardhat test
 
 TinyVillage Test
    âˆš Should mint village (5832ms)
    âˆš Should mint castle (2321ms)
  2 passing (8s)
```
#### [tineyVillageTest.js complete code ](https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/blob/main/demo/test/tineyVillageTest.js)

### Creat a Celo account with Hardhat
To deploy your contract on Celo Testnet will need to create a account and save the address to sent Celo test coin,In main folder create a file ```celo_account.js```,we'll not use the default accounts, because we'll need to save account to use later.

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3')
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const web3 = new Web3()
const privateKeyFile = path.join(__dirname, './.secret')

//Function getAccount will return the address of your account
const getAccount = () => {
    const secret = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyFile);
    const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(secret.toString())
    return account;
}

//Function setAccount will crate new account and save the privateKey in .secret file 
const setAccount = () => {
    const newAccount = web3.eth.accounts.create()
    fs.writeFileSync(privateKeyFile, newAccount.privateKey, (err) => {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
        }
    })
    console.log(`Address ${newAccount.address}`)
}
module.exports = {
    getAccount,
    setAccount
}
```
In the ```hardhat.config.js``` import necessary modules to read .secret file and the code you wrote above; 
```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const privateKeyFile = path.join(__dirname, './.secret')
const Account = require('./celo_account');
```
Below of others task add new task,if the .secret file does not exist the task will create a new account, if the .secret file exists the task will use the privateKey to get the address
```javascript
task("celo-account", "Prints account address or create a new", async () => {
    fs.existsSync(privateKeyFile) ? console.log(`Address ${Account.getAccount().address}`) : Account.setAccount();
});
```
When run ```npx hardhat celo-account```, the new account are created and the privateKey will saved into .secret file,Is important save the address and go to this website  [Celo faucets ](https://celo.org/developers/faucets) https://celo.org/developers/faucet,get the coins are necessary to pay the fee to deploy.
```bash
 npx hardhat celo-account
 
 Address <your new address>
```

# Use Hardhat to deploy
If your code is already tested, it's time to deploy ,to deploy your smart contract you will need to connect to Celo BlockChain, to do this you will need a server running the Celo network,to connect to Celo and another Blockchain network one of the easiest ways and using figment DataHub, in the [DataHub (figment.io)](https://datahub.figment.io/) and chose Celo, copy celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io and save the api key ![Captura de Tela (43)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52639395/114647928-46c08300-9cb4-11eb-90a4-5a8600c7696d.png),Create ```celo_deploy.js``` and write the code bellow,```@celo/contractkit``` is a library to help developers and validators to interact with the celo-blockchain,```TinyVillage()``` is the function used to deploy TinyVillage contract,the ```/artifacts/contracts/TinyVillage.sol/TinyVillage.json```is the file that contains all the information about our compiled contract,to deploy you'll need of [DataHub (figment.io)](https://datahub.figment.io/) to interact will need of 
```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3')
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit')

const web3 = new Web3('https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/<key>/')
const kit = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3)
const data = require('./artifacts/contracts/TinyVillage.sol/TinyVillage.json')
const Account = require('./celo_account');

async function TinyVillage() {
    const account = Account.getAccount()
    kit.connection.addAccount(account.privateKey) 
    let tx = await kit.connection.sendTransaction({
        from: account.address,
        data: data.bytecode
    })
     return tx.waitReceipt()
}
module.exports = {
    TinyVillage
}
```
the same you did in ```task("celo-account"}``` it's time to create a task to deploy
```javascript
const Deploy = require('./celo_deploy');
```
```javascript
task("celo-deploy", "Prints account address or create a new", async () => {
    const tx = await Deploy.TinyVillage();
    console.log(tx);
    console.log(`save the contract address ${tx.contractAddress}`)
});
```

Run the task ```npx hardhat celo-deploy``` to deploy, then save the contract address to use in your react app to inreact with smart contract,after you run If everything goes right the result should look like this
```bash
npx hardhat celo-deploy

{

# Creat a react app
Sites like [opensea.io] (https://opensea.io/) and another NFT marketplaces do not yet support Celo to see your Nfts we will build a reaction application,to did not build a react app from scratch download de souce code from [github] (https://github.com/lucasespinosa28/Celo-Tutorial/),open the folder ```demo\start```, and run:
```bash
npm install
```
Open the file ```src/Images.js``` and write the code in the place indicated by comment.
```javascript
//Access a the contract
const contract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(data.abi, "0x47A424A0975924C3d177470C519C8DBA37e16Ec9")
//Array with address NFT's owner 
const ownerAddress = [address, address, address, address, address]
//Array with NFT's id      
const ownerIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
//Function that will return the NFT that you have
async function getBalance() {
 const balances = await contract.methods.balanceOfBatch(ownerAddress, ownerIds).call();
 setBalanceArray(balances);
 }
```
This code work accessing the smart contract using  ```kit.web3.eth.Contract...```,The code has 2 arrays one with user address and the other with list NFTs id , when use ***balanceOfBatch*** will return a array with each NFT that the user has depends on the balance the code will show a specific image for each array combination,example: if balanceOfBatch returns ***[1,0,0,0,0]*** the code will show this image
![village](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52639395/115546874-ee711e80-a27b-11eb-90e5-2febf733aabc.jpg)

Open the file ```src/MintNFT.js```,this code work getting the balance like the ***Images.js***,write the code below to showing the button to mint  the NFT


the code below work like the Images.js ,but it's create a button only if is possible to mint the NFT
```javascript
 //Access a the contract
        const contract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(data.abi, "0x47A424A0975924C3d177470C519C8DBA37e16Ec9")
        //Array with address NFT's owner 
        const ownerAddress = [address, address, address, address, address]
        //Array with NFT's id     
        const ownerIds = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        //Function that will return the NFT that you have
        async function getBalance() {
            const data = await contract.methods.balanceOfBatch(ownerAddress, ownerIds).call();
            setBalanceArray(data);
        }
        // Run the code above 
        getBalance();
        //this function will coin NFT depending on the name you give 
        async function Mint(name) {
            console.log(balanceArray);
            contract.methods.[name]().send({ from: address })
                .on('transactionHash', function (hash) {
                    console.log(hash);
                })
                .on('receipt', function (receipt) {
                    console.log(receipt);
                })
                .on('error', function (error, receipt) {
                    console.log(error);
                    console.log(receipt);
                });
        }
```

To not create a function to mintVillage,mintFarm,mintMine and etc, the same function will mint an NFT using the name of the function it has in the smart contract ,
example:
```javascript
 async function Mint("mintVillage") {
  contract.methods.["mintVillage"]().send(...
 }
 Mint("mintVillage")}
 ....
 contract.methods.["mintVillage"]().send({ from: address })
 //if not using this method
 contract.methods.mintVillage().send({ from: address })
 ....
 contract.methods.mintCastle().send({ from: address })
 ....
```
if the code have any error, test the app
```bash
npm start
```

after you connect to a account send go to [Celo faucets ](https://celo.org/developers/faucets) and get the test coin to star buying the NFT,first you need to buy a village and next you will need to farm and mine do pass to next level

# Learning more
how this tutorial was about how writer smart contract and use Hardhat to learning more about Celo, you read the [Celo contractkit ](https://docs.celo.org/v/master/developer-guide/contractkit) and the  [Celo dappkit ](https://docs.celo.org/v/master/developer-guide/dappkit)
